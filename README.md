## Compiling .dat File

Within the two folders are contained two files. For the sake of simplification, the structure of the two files and their meaning are shown below

   * Name File.lua -> The file that contains the LUA code
   * Name File.lua.TGI -> The file that contains the TGI of the LUA code.
   
In order to generate a .dat file that the format needed for the code to be read by the game you have to use a tool such as Reader or Ilives Reader.

Once the program is open you should create an empty file and from there prmete the right mouse button to open a dropdown and select Import File.

Once this is done select the .lua file and press open.

After you have done this procedure you have to press yes at the information window where there is this step *No Entry Selected. Append to End?* and then an Unknown file appears with the exact TGI and LUA code.

Save the new file and reopen it to get the LUA file instead of Unknown
